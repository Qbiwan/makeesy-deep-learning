# Classification Loss functions-
# 1. Negative Log-Likelihood Loss Function
# 2. Cross Entropy Function

# NLL Loss
# 1. Used with a model having softmax as the lass layer.
# 2. As the output of softmax layer is between 0, and 1, and the log will be negative.
# 3. So negative sign is mainly to make the end loss positive.
# NLL does not only make the model to predict correctly but also with high confidence.
